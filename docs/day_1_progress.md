# Share-out Day 1

## Progress

## Approach

Diagrammed work described in paper, trying to understand their workflow.

Started working on piecemeal approach, each person working on a separate piece rather than trying to start at the beginning and reproduce the entire paper. There was just too much work that was unclear how it was done to replicate the work en toto
